# Welcome to WhereDoc

## Who are we?

WhereDoc aims to show you which Doctor is available for the treatment
you or your loved ones need. In a place like Male where there are
Hospitals, Clinics and Medical centers, we often do not know where we
should go to meet which doctor and if that doctor is on leave or not.
WhereDoc checks this information for you and present it so you do not
have to worry about wasting time or waiting long queues when there is
a professional you can meet in half the time

## Why are we Open Source?

We are open source to show that we do not illegally take data from any of the respective hospitals, clinics and health centers. Moreover, we only scrap existing publically available data from the respective sources and have all code shown to prove our practices being legal. If we do get data from the source directly, it will be mentioned in this README.md
